Bindings to =zmq= in Emacs.

[[https://melpa.org/#/zmq][file:https://melpa.org/packages/zmq-badge.svg]] [[https://github.com/nnicandro/emacs-zmq][file:https://github.com/nnicandro/emacs-zmq/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg]]

* Installation

*NOTE:* Your Emacs needs to have been built with module support!

The recommended way to install this package is through the built-in package
manager in Emacs.

Ensure MELPA is in your =package-archives=

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
#+END_SRC

Ensure the latest versions of MELPA packages are available

=M-x package-refresh-contents RET=

Install ZMQ

=M-x package-install RET zmq RET=

Once installed, on the first call to =(require 'zmq)= you will be presented
with the option to either download one of the module binaries available on the
[[https://github.com/dzop/emacs-zmq/releases][releases]] page that is compatible with your system (and based on the variable
=system-configuration=) or, if there isn't a binary available for download, to
build the C module.

*NOTE:* In order to download the module binaries it is best to have [[https://curl.haxx.se/][curl]]
installed on your system since the built-in Emacs method for downloading files,
=url-retrieve=, has issues with HTTPS connections on some systems. On Windows,
if your Emacs was not built with the proper =GnuTLS= support (which appears to
be the default), =curl= is necessary. If you run into issues you can always
manually download the module and ensure the =emacs-zmq.(dll|so)= file is placed
in the same directory as the =zmq.el= file.

** Dependencies

- libzmq :: https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq
** Building

Run =make= in the top level directory to build the =zmq= module. Alternatively
when running =(require 'zmq)= and the module is not built already, you will be
asked to build it.

Note, the =autotools= collection must be available on your system in order to
build the module as well as the =pkg-config= tool.

By default =pkg-config= is used to search for a usable =libzmq= to use, falling
back to downloading and building a local copy if necessary.

You can tell =pkg-config= to use a specific =libzmq= by setting the environment
variables =ZMQ_LIBS= and =ZMQ_CFLAGS= before building the module. The module
will link to the =libzmq= that those variables point to if it can. Note, when
linking =libzmq= in this way, the =zmq_poller= interface is required. This
means that the linked =libzmq= needs to have been configured using the option
=--enable-drafts=yes= if =libzmq= < 4.3.1.

If =ZMQ_LIBS= and =ZMQ_CFLAGS= are not set or they point to a =libzmq= that
isn't usable, a local copy of =libzmq= is downloaded, built, and statically
linked into the resulting module. The default version of =libzmq= built in this
case is 4.3.1 and can be changed by specifying the environment variable
=ZMQ_VERSION=, e.g. to something like

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
ZMQ_VERSION=4.3.0
#+END_SRC

*** Windows

Only the MinGW version of Emacs is supported at the moment, i.e. the one you
would get with the command

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-emacs
#+END_SRC

in a MinGW shell.

Alternatively you can build an Emacs with module support by following the
instructions [[https://sourceforge.net/p/emacsbinw64/wiki/Build%20guideline%20for%20MSYS2-MinGW-w64%20system/][here]]. You will need to pass the =--with-modules= option to the
=configure= script when building.

See the instructions below on how to install the MinGW tools.
**** Download the pre-built libraries

You can download a tar archive containing the pre-built Windows dll files
necessary to use this package. Inside the archive is an =emacs-zmq.dll= file
containing v4.3.1 of =libzmq=. See the [[https://github.com/dzop/emacs-zmq/releases][releases]] page.

After downloading, extract the archive contents into the same directory as this
project.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd ~/.emacs.d/elpa/<zmq directory>
wget https://github.com/dzop/emacs-zmq/releases/download/v0.10.9/emacs-zmq-x86_64-w64-mingw32.tar.gz
tar -xzf emacs-zmq-x86_64-w64-mingw32.tar.gz
#+END_SRC

**** Build using MinGW

It is possible to use the included build chain on Windows using the [[https://www.msys2.org/][MSYS2]] MinGW
tools.

Install the 64-bit toolchain inside the MSYS2 shell via
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
pacman -S base-devel
pacman -S git
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
#+END_SRC

Note: If you are using the official Git for Windows instead of MSYS2 Git, make
sure to set

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git config --global core.autocrlf false
#+END_SRC

during the build to avoid EOL issues and set it back to =true= (the default on
Windows) when you are done building.

Start the build from an MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit shell via =make=.

** Testing

Run =make test= in the top level directory.
* Contexts

To create a context:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(zmq-context)
#+END_SRC

Normally only a single context object for the current Emacs session is
necessary so the usual way to get the context for the current Emacs session is
to call =zmq-current-context= which will create a context for the session only
if one has not been created already. See [[id:7E843F84-F15C-42EA-8BA5-BCB91717ABBE][Context/socket/poller lifetime
management]].

Below is a table mapping the C API functions to their Emacs equivalent.

* Sockets
:PROPERTIES:
:Effort:   10
:END:

To create a socket:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(zmq-socket (zmq-current-context) zmq-PUB)
#+END_SRC

To bind a socket:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(zmq-bind sock "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555")
#+END_SRC

To receive a message without blocking:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(let (msg)
  (while (null (condition-case err
                   (setq msg (zmq-recv sock zmq-NOBLOCK))
                (zmq-EAGAIN nil)))
    (sleep-for 1)))
#+END_SRC

Below is a table mapping the C API functions to their Emacs equivalent.

| C                | emacs-lisp       |
|------------------+------------------|
| =zmq_socket=     | =zmq-socket=     |
| =zmq_send=       | =zmq-send=       |
| =zmq_recv=       | =zmq-recv=       |

| =zmq_setsockopt= | =zmq-socket-set= |
| =zmq_getsockopt= | =zmq-socket-get= |

In addition to the above, there are also some convenience functions for working
with sockets. Currently this is only the function =zmq-bind-to-random-port=
which takes a socket and an address and binds the socket to a random port on
the address:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(zmq-bind-to-random-port sock "tcp://127.0.0.1") ; returns port number
#+END_SRC
* Messages

To create a new message object use =zmq-message=

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(zmq-message)
#+END_SRC

The above creates and initializes an empty message. You can also pass a string
or a vector of bytes to =zmq-message= to initialize the message with some data

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(zmq-message "[mα, mβ] = iℏmγ")
;; Initialize a message with a vector of bytes
(zmq-message [0 10 100 29])
#+END_SRC

| =zmq_msg_set_group=      | =zmq-message-set-group=      |
** Multi-part messages

To send a multi-part message:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(zmq-send-multipart sock '("part1" "part2" "part3"))
#+END_SRC

To receive a multi-part message:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(zmq-recv-multipart sock)
#+END_SRC

=zmq-recv-multipart= returns a list containing the parts of the message and
always returns a list, even for a message containing a single part.
* Polling

Currently, polling requires that =libzmq= be built with the draft API to expose
the =zmq_poller= interface. Below is an example of how you may poll a socket.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(catch 'recvd
  (let ((poller (zmq-poller))
        (timeout 1000))
    (zmq-poller-add poller sock (list zmq-POLLIN zmq-POLLOUT))
    (while t
      ;; `zmq-poller-wait-all' returns an alist of elements (sock . events)
      (let* ((socks-events (zmq-poller-wait-all poller 1 timeout))
             (events (cdr (zmq-assoc sock socks-events))))
        (when (and events (member zmq-POLLIN events))
          (throw 'recvd (zmq-recv sock)))))))
#+END_SRC

Below is a table mapping the C API functions to their Emacs equivalent.

| C                      | emacs-lisp            |
|------------------------+-----------------------|
| =zmq_poller_new=       | =zmq-poller=          |
| =zmq_poller_destroy=   | =zmq-poller-destroy=  |
| =zmq_poller_add=       | =zmq-poller-add=      |
| =zmq_poller_add_fd=    | =zmq-poller-add=      |
| =zmq_poller_modify=    | =zmq-poller-modify=   |
| =zmq_poller_modify_fd= | =zmq-poller-modify=   |
| =zmq_poller_remove=    | =zmq-poller-remove=   |
| =zmq_poller_remove_fd= | =zmq-poller-remove=   |
| =zmq_poller_wait=      | =zmq-poller-wait=     |
| =zmq_poller_wait_all=  | =zmq-poller-wait-all= |
* Errors

All errors generated by the underlying =C= API are converted into calls to
=signal= in Emacs. So to handle errors, wrap your calls to =zmq= functions in a
=condition-case= like so

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq poll-events
      (while (null (condition-case nil
                       (zmq-poller-wait poller 1)
                     (zmq-EAGAIN nil)))
        (sleep-for 1)))
#+END_SRC

The error symbols used are identical to the C error codes
except with the prefix =zmq-=. Only the more common errors
are defined as error symbols that can be caught with
=condition-case=, below is the current list of errors that
have error symbols defined:

| EINVAL          |
| EPROTONOSUPPORT |
| ENOCOMPATPROTO  |
| EADDRINUSE      |
| EADDRNOTAVAIL   |
| ENODEV          |
| ETERM           |
| ENOTSOCK        |
| EMTHREAD        |
| EFAULT          |
| EINTR           |
| ENOTSUP         |
| ENOENT          |
| ENOMEM          |
| EAGAIN          |
| EFSM            |
| EHOSTUNREACH    |
| EMFILE          |

Any other error will signal a =zmq-ERROR= with an error
message obtained from =zmq_strerror=.
* Comparing ZMQ objects

There are also predicate and comparison functions available for working with
ZMQ objects:

| zmq-poller-p  |
| zmq-socket-p  |
| zmq-context-p |
| zmq-message-p |
| zmq-equal     |
| zmq-assoc     |

=zmq-equal= and =zmq-assoc= work just like =equal= and =assoc= respectively,
but can also compare ZMQ objects.
* Getting/setting options

To set an option for a =zmq-context=, =zmq-socket=, or =zmq-message= call:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(zmq-context-set ctx zmq-BLOCKY nil)
(zmq-socket-set sock zmq-IPV6 t)
(zmq-message-set msg zmq-MORE t)
#+END_SRC

To get an option:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(zmq-context-get ctx zmq-BLOCKY)
(zmq-socket-get sock zmq-IPV6)
(zmq-message-get msg zmq-MORE)
#+END_SRC

Or the convenience functions =zmq-set-option= and =zmq-get-option= can be used
which will call one of the functions above based on the type of the first
argument:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(zmq-set-option ctx zmq-BLOCKY nil)
(zmq-set-option sock zmq-IPV6 t)

(zmq-get-option ctx zmq-BLOCKY)
(zmq-get-option sock zmq-IPV6)
#+END_SRC

To access a =zmq-message= meta-data property use =zmq-message-property=:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(zmq-message-property msg :identity)
#+END_SRC

The available metadata properties can be found in =zmq-message-properties=.

** Boolean options

Integer options which are interpreted as boolean in =libzmq= are interpreted in
Emacs as boolean. For example, the socket option =zmq-IPV6= which enables IPV6
connections for the socket is an integer option interpreted as a boolean value
in the C API. In Emacs this option is a boolean. So to enable IPV6 connections
you would do

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(zmq-socket-set sock zmq-IPV6 t)
#+END_SRC

and to disable them

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(zmq-socket-set sock zmq-IPV6 nil)
#+END_SRC

Similarly for all other socket, message, or context options which are
interpreted as boolean by the C API.
* Context/socket/poller lifetime management
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       7E843F84-F15C-42EA-8BA5-BCB91717ABBE
:END:

The underlying Emacs module takes care of freeing the resources used by a ZMQ
object during garbage collection. As a special case if a socket gets garbage
collected, the =zmq-LINGER= property will be set to 0 for the socket
(http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#Making-a-Clean-Exit). You probably still
want to call the appropriate destructor function once your done using an object
though.
* Asynchronous subprocess

There is also support for asynchronous processing via an Emacs subprocess. This
is useful to have a subprocess do most of the message processing for an
application, leaving the parent Emacs process free for editing tasks. To start
a subprocess you pass a function form to =zmq-start-process= like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(zmq-start-process
 `(lambda ()
    (let* ((ctx (zmq-current-context))
           (sock (zmq-socket ctx zmq-SUB)))
      BODY)))
#+END_SRC

Notice the quoting on the function, this is necessary to pass a lambda form to
the subprocess as opposed to a byte-compiled lambda or closure. Given the above
function, a subprocess will be created and the provided function will be called
in the subprocess environment. You can also avoid a call to
=zmq-current-context= by providing a function that takes a single argument. In
this case, the argument will be set to the =zmq-current-context= in the
subprocess environment:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(zmq-start-process
 `(lambda (ctx)
    (let ((sock (zmq-socket ctx zmq-SUB)))
      BODY)))
#+END_SRC

There are also routines to pass information between a subprocess and the parent
Emacs process. You can send an s-expression, readable using =read=, to a
subprocess with the function =zmq-subprocess-send=. The subprocess can then
consume the sent expression by a call to =zmq-subprocess-read=. Note that
=zmq-subprocess-read= is blocking. To avoid this blocking behavior you can poll
the =stdin= stream to ensure that something can be read before calling
=zmq-subprocess-read= in the subprocess, see the example below.

For the parent Emacs process to read data from a subprocess, the subprocess
should print an expression to =stdout=, e.g. using the function =zmq-prin1=,
and give a filter function to the =:filter= key of the =zmq-start-process=
call. The filter function is similar to a normal process filter function but
only takes a single argument, a list expression that was printed to the
=stdout= of a subprocess. Note, in the subprocess, *the expressions printed to*
*=stdout= are restricted to be lists*. There is no such restriction when using
=zmq-subprocess-send=.

Below is a complete example of using =zmq-start-process=

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(let ((proc (zmq-start-process
             `(lambda (ctx)
                (let ((poller (zmq-poller)))
                  ;; Poll for input on STDIN, i.e. input from the parent Emacs
                  ;; process. NOTE: Only works on UNIX based systems.
                  (zmq-poller-add poller 0 zmq-POLLIN)
                  (catch 'exit
                    (while t
                      (when (zmq-poller-wait poller 100)
                        (let ((sexp (zmq-subprocess-read)))
                          (zmq-prin1 sexp)
                          (throw 'exit t)))))))
             ;; A filter function which prints out messages sent by the
             ;; subprocess.
             :filter (lambda (sexp)
                       (message "echo %s" sexp)))))
  ;; Let the process start
  (sleep-for 0.2)
  (zmq-subprocess-send proc (list 'send "topic1")))
#+END_SRC
